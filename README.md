# UNFINISHED
I wouldn't recommend you use this code as a reference for building an emulator, not because it's bad code but simply because it is in an unfinished state.

Some useful references are:
- [pandocs (reference docs)](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/)
- [mohanson/gameboy (Rust emulator)](https://github.com/mohanson/gameboy)
- [djworld/gameboycolor (Go GBC emulator)](https://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor)
- [LIJI32/SameBoy (C emulator)](https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy)
